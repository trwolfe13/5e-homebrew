This spell can be used to communicate with a sleeping creature. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep cannot be contacted with this spell, but those that can enter trance-like states (such as elves) can. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance state, the messenger is considered sleeping and unaware of their surroundings.

If the target of the spell is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, for the duration of the spell. The messenger and the target can emerge from the dream at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. Both the target and the messenger recall the dream perfectly upon waking.

If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

*DM's Note: While in the dream link, the messenger is vulnerable to spirits or other forces that pray on the sleeping. The dreamcatcher is meant to defend against this, but is at the DM's discretion.*
