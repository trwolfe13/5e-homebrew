You flick your wrist with a flourish, causing a single object that weighs no more than 5lbs that you hold within your hand to vanish. The object is transported and stored within a small extra-dimensional pocket plane.

The object remains there indefinitely until this cantrip is cast again upon which it is immediately transported back into your grasp. You cannot store more than one object at a time in this way.
