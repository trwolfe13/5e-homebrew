# Way of Amun-Ra  

## Monastic Tradition

At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition feature. Here is a new option for that feature: the Way of Amun-Ra.

### Way of Amun-Ra

Sworn to the service of the Pharaoh, as both guardians and assassins, the monks of Amun-Ra train for optimum stealth and efficiency, and are a deadly force.

#### Path of Amun-Ra

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. Choose two types of weapons to be your specialist weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don’t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you.

#### Wild Style

At 3rd level, you have long studied animals in their natural habitat and incorporated their movements into your fighting style. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to enact/impose one of the following effects:
* ***Asp Sting.*** The target takes 2d6 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.
* ***Scarab' Shell.*** You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while you are not incapacitated.
* ***Crocodile's Bite.*** The target becomes grappled.
* ***Ox's Strength.*** The target must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can spend 2 ki points to deal an extra 3d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack. The attack must use a monk weapon or your unarmed strike.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, in a number of d6s equal to half your Monk level rounded up.

#### Assassinate

Starting at 11th level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

```
```

#### Redirection

At 17th level, you have learned to turn your enemy's strength against them. When an enemy misses you, or a creature that you can see within 5 feet of you, with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit the attacker, or another creature of your choice, that you can see within 5 feet of you.
