# The Unfathomed Depths

In the unexplored deeps of the world's oceans lurks a terrible creature. An unfathomable beast of power, subsumed in the crushing depths.

## Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence - not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### Depths of the Ocean

Your patron is the Unfathomed Depths, a dark creature at the bottom of the ocean, or perhaps the will of the ocean itself. It has granted you power to some terrible end, but what does it want from you in return?

#### Expanded Spell List

The Unfathomed Depths lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Unfathomed Depths Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *Create or Destroy Water, Fog Cloud* |
| 2nd  | *Blindness/Deafness, Silence* |
| 3rd  | *Water Breathing, Watery Sphere* |
| 4th  | *Control Water, Freedom of Movement* |
| 5th  | *Cone of cold, Maelstrom* |

#### Pact of the Key

At 1st level, your patron grants you the ability to move freely in water. You can breathe underwater, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

You also learn the cantrip *shape water*. This counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but does not count against your number of cantrips known.

#### Watery Defense

At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage.

You also gain the ability to defend yourself by momentarily assuming a watery form. When you are hit by an attack and take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from it, you can use your reaction to grant yourself resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Creature of the Deep

At 10th level, your patron grants you the ability to survive in the harsh depths of the ocean. You are immune to the effects of deep water.

Additionally, you patron teaches you to harness the hypnotic call of the ocean. You can use your action to cast the spell *compulsion* without expending a spell slot, and with the following alterations:
- Your range for the spell increases to 120 ft.
- You can choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

Once you have used this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Shape of Water

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to enter a liquid state while moving.

When you move on your turn, you take only half damage from opportunity attacks, and you can move through any enemy's space but can't willingly end your move there.

On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you're in a space one size smaller than you. You can't willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if you're forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space that can fit you, back along the path of your movement.
