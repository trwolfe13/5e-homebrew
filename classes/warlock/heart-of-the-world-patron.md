# The Heart of the World

Amidst the gods, fiends and fey, there exists an entity as old as the material plane itself. The Heart of the World is the will of the planet manifest. 

## Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence - not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### Heart of the World

Your patron is the Heart of the World, a metaphysical entity manifested of the will of the planet. It has beseeched you to be both its guardian and its champion, keeping the balance between the planes of existence.

You are bestowed with an object that functions as both a key and a weapon: a keyblade. 

#### Expanded Spell List

The Heart of the World lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Heart of the World Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *Cure Wounds, Shield of Faith* |
| 2nd  | *Aid, Branding Smite* |
| 3rd  | *Aura of Vitality, Elemental Weapon* |
| 4th  | *Banishment, Staggering Smite* |
| 5th  | *Banishing Smite, Mass Cure Wounds* |



#### Pact of the Key

When you choose this patron at 1st level, you are required to take the Pact of the Blade feature at 3rd level. When you do, your Pact of the Blade ability is augmented. Your Pact Weapon assumes the form of a key-shaped blade. 

Your pact weapon no longer disappears if it is more than 5 feet away. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon your pact weapon as a bonus action on your turn, instead of an action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

Your pact weapon adopts the statistics of a longsword and you cannot be disarmed of it unless you are incapacitated.

```
```

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Synch Blade

At 10th level, you gain the ability to split your pact weapon in two. As a bonus action, you can cause your pact weapon to split or rejoin. When split, each weapon adopts the statistics of a shortsword and you gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are dual wielding.

#### Doors Between Worlds

Starting at 14th level, you unlock the true power of the key blade. Once per long rest, you can cast the Plane Shift spell, using your pact weapon in place of the spell's material components, specifying a plane of which the warlock is aware.

## Eldritch Invocations

#### Silence
*Prerequisites: 9th level, Heart of the World patron*

You use your keyblade to lock away the voice of another creature. Choose a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or lose the ability to speak for up to 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on that target. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

#### Strike Raid
*Prerequisites: Heart of the World patron*
<br><br>
When you take the Attack action, you can use your pact weapon to make a ranged weapon attack. Your pact weapon gains a range of 20/60 ft.

After you make a ranged attack in this way, your pact weapon magically returns to your hand.

#### Work Undone
*Prerequisites: 5th level, Heart of the World patron*
<br><br>
Your keyblade can be used to unbind magic. You can cast *counterspell* or *dispel magic* once without expending a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
