### Divine Right
Though the origin of the race is uncertain, legend tells us the khametian race was born when the sun-god Ra fell in love with a human woman. Born with sunlight in their soul, their children were the first of Khamet, and the only race to thrive in the hostile desert of Tahmad. Over millennia, their line has grown strong, and a divine spark still burns in the khametian soul, and is reflected in their commanding presence.

### Untouched by Fire
The khametians are an industrial and resourceful people, having expanded a vast empire of cities amongst the ocean of sand that is the harsh desert of Tahmad. The blistering sun bears down incessantly, relenting only to the moon. Through millennia of constant heat, assisted by their divine heritage, the khametian people have developed a high tolerance to the heat of the desert.

### An Empire of Sand
Amidst the endless Tahmadi desert, the khametians have engineered sophisticated engineering techniques to create glass and stone from their most abundant resource: sand. The pinnacle of khametian architecture is the pyramid. Huge triangular structures that reach toward the heavens, and throw shade across the sand.
