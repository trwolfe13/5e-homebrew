# Desperate Strength

There comes a time in every adventurer's life when all hope seems lost; when all the turnings of the worlds have led to a single, defining moment: do, or die. In these desperate times, an adventurer may call upon the last essence of their strength, be it granted by patron, deity or their own soul. In this final surge, the power achieved will be great, but the cost may be greater still.

## Mechanics

When a player character, or indeed villain is in desperate need, as an action, that character can make a plea to their patron, deity or inner strength to temporarily gain great power. The nature of this power is determined by the plea and the character's source of strength. See the later section on examples by class.

After making the plea, the character must roll on the Great Cost table to determine the outcome. The cost takes effect after the effect of the plea has run its course. For example, if a raging barbarian gets 4 extra attacks, the character won't become exhausted until after the attacks have been made. In some circumstances, this may not be appropriate. If a cleric receives divine intervention and an enemy receives a debuff, then the cost should happen after the debuff takes effect, not when it wears off.

#### Great Cost
|  d100  | Cost                                                 |
|:------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
| 01-05  | Instant death                                        |
| 06-20  | Roll on the Indefinite Madness table (DMG, page 260) |
| 21-55  | Roll on the Long Term Madness table (DMG, page 260)  |
| 56-80  | Roll on the Short Term Madness table (DMG, page 259) |
| 81-95  | 2 points of exhaustion                               |
| 96-100 | 1 point of exhaustion                                |

### Variant Rule: Plea

In games with a higher level of roleplaying, you can adjust the DCs of the table based on the quality or appropriateness of the character's plea. An idea of these DCs is listed below.

#### Plea
| Poor  | Average | Excellent | Great Cost             |
|:------|:-------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|
| 01-10 |  01-05  |      1    | Instant death          |
| 11-30 |  06-20  |   02-10   | Indefinite Madness     |
| 31-70 |  21-55  |   11-40   | Long Term Madness      |
| 71-90 |  56-80  |   41-70   | Short Term Madness     |
| 91-99 |  81-95  |   71-85   | 2 points of exhaustion |
|   100 |  96-100 |   86-100  | 1 point of exhaustion  |

## Disclaimer

This rule, whilst dangerous, obviously has the potential to be very overpowered, so exact timings and effects should be down to DM discretion. If the costs are not great, players will be more inclined to enact this rule as a group or at the beginning of a boss battle.
